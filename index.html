            My name is Karlelisa. I live in Boston, MA. I have been living in Boston for about 5 years. I grew up in
            Revere, MA.
            I work in the accounting field and I want a career change to be a software developer. I want to obtain
            technical skills to be able to design, develop, maintain, test and evaluate computer software. This field is
            very fascinating to me.
            I want a career that challenges me, that is continuously growing and fullfills my intellectual curiousity.
        </p>

        <p>I enjoy traveling around the world. I try to travel somewhere new every year. I love to explore different
            countries and meet different people.
            The furthest country I traveled to so far is Thailand. I went to Bangkok and Phuket. It was an incredible
            experience walking through the streets of Bangkok, visiting temples, riding an elephant in the jungle,
            eating delicious pad thai and relaxing on a luxury beach resort in Phuket.
